# \# Sorting Algorithm Performance Comparison

# 

# This project implements and compares the execution time of three classic sorting algorithms in Java: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Merge Sort. Each algorithm is applied to the same dataset to evaluate performance and correctness.

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# The code includes:

# \- Implementations of Bubble Sort (with verbose and flag optimizations), Selection Sort, and Merge Sort

# \- Time measurement for each sorting method

# \- Output of sorted arrays for validation

# 

# \## Algorithms

# 

# | Algorithm       | Time Complexity | Description                                      |

# |----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

# | Bubble Sort     | O(n²)            | Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements  |

# | Selection Sort  | O(n²)            | Selects the smallest element and places it in order |

# | Merge Sort      | O(n log n)       | Recursively divides and merges sorted subarrays |

# 

# \## Usage

# 

# 1\. Compile and run the Java program.

# 2\. Choose the sorting method to apply.

# 3\. View the sorted output and execution time in seconds.
